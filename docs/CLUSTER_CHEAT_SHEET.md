## 1. More general commands

### 1.1. Regular expression to search nodes in the ns2mobility.xml files (not cluster related)

```regex
\$node_\(\d+\)\s+set\s+X_\s+4900\b\s*\n\$node_\(\d+\)\s+set\s+Y_\s+4900\b

\$node_\(\d+\)\s+set\s+X_\s+1600\b\s*\n\$node_\(\d+\)\s+set\s+Y_\s+1600\b\s*\n\$node_\(\d+\)\s+set\s+Z_\s+1600\b
```

### 1.2. Paste selected text in terminal:

```
Shift+Insert
```

### 1.3. Execute the command later on the cluster (not slurm! 
The cluster machine will submit the slurm jobs later at the chosen time

```bash
# submit all the slurm jobs found in the current folder in 4 hours
mkdir -p logs && echo "cd $PWD && /home/nursino/storage/Vanets-ns3-fb/scheduled_jobs/submitall.sh > logs/submitall.log 2>&1" | at now + 4 hours

# move the jobs you want to submit (*STATIC*) and them submit them all in 10 hours
mkdir -p logs && echo "cd $PWD && mv tosubmitlater/*STATIC* . && /home/nursino/storage/Vanets-ns3-fb/scheduled_jobs/submitall.sh > logs/submitall.log 2>&1" | at now + 10 hours

# move the jobs you want to submit (*ROFF*) and them submit them all in 11 hours
mkdir -p logs && echo "cd $PWD && mv tosubmitlater/*ROFF* . && /home/nursino/storage/Vanets-ns3-fb/scheduled_jobs/submitall.sh > logs/submitall.log 2>&1" | at now + 11 hours
```

To see the list of jobs scheduled with the `at` command

```bash
at -l
```

To see the queued command

```bash
at -c 5
```

To cancel a queued command

```bash
atrm 5 #5 is just an example
```

### 1.4. Search just for the line and print it (to see how much time a simulation took):

```bash
grep '^Whole simulation Elapsed wall-clock time:' *.out
```

### 1.5. Print on screen all lines of csv files in current directory

```bash
(head -n 1 *.csv | head -n 1) && tail -n +2 -q *.csv
head -n 1 $(ls *.csv | head -n 1) && tail -n +2 -q *.csv # with header

```
### 1.6. Git clean recursively just one folder

```bash
# Remove the --dry-run if it is the expected result
find . -type d -name "ROFF" -exec git clean -fd --dry-run {} \;

# with escaping characters
find . -type d -name "cw\[16-128\]" -exec git clean -fd --dry-run {} \;
```

## 2. Slurm commands

### 2.1. Show queue status:

```bash
squeue
```

### 2.2. Show cluster queues and status:

```bash
sinfo -l -v
```

### 2.3. Show nodes (computing machines):

```bash
scontrol show node
```

### 2.4. Cancel slurm jobs. 
As `job_id` you can use either the whole array (######) or a single element (######_##)

```bash
scancel job_id
```

### 2.5. Change time limit of queued job (not running)

```bash
scontrol update JobId=<job_id> TimeLimit=15:30:00
```

### 2.6. Show a particular node:

```bash
scontrol show node <node_name>
```

### 2.7. Submit a job:

```bash
sbatch file.slurm
```

### 2.8. Move a folder from the cluster to your local machine. Add -n for dry run (just test no transfer)

```bash
rsync -avz --progress --partial --append-verify --remove-source-files cluster:/storage/nursino/Vanets-ns3-fb/scripts/draw_coords/out/ /media/Dati-2/tesi/network-visual/from-cluster/
```

Then, after youâ€™ve confirmed files transferred and source files were removed, clean up empty directories with:

```bash
ssh cluster 'find /storage/nursino/Vanets-ns3-fb/scripts/draw_coords/out -type d -empty -delete'
```
